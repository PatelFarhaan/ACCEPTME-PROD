                            unusual/suspicious activity which eventually freezes your account. There is no need to panic your

                                We would like to keep it transparent to you. As per the Instagram algorithm, when multiple requests
                                are accepted at once, not all requests are processed successfully. <br> <br>  We have built our app to get
                                the maximum possible successful percentage(up to 99%). Nevertheless, <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">the requests which are
                      failed don't get deleted,</span> so you do not have to worry about it. Just be aware that in the next
                                round you can get them accepted.
